	<p>Considering that it set a record for the shortest time a film has ever taken to make $2 billion at the box office, chances are pretty good that you've already seen Avengers: Endgame and don't need this spoiler warning for one of the movie's major plot points. Like many of us expected going into the theater, Tony Stark doesn't make make it out of Endgame alive — he sacrifices his life to defeat Thanos once and for all, and as the character who launched the entire franchise, his death puts a bookend on the first 11 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

</p>

	Marvel fans had been bracing themselves for Tony's death, but it still raises a pretty big question about what's going to happen going forward. Since so much of that universe has been built around Stark and his armor-clad alter ego, his absence leaves a pretty big vacuum that's bound to be filled, one way or another. Here's how Iron Man just might return after the events of Endgame.
