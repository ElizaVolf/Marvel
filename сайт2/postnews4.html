		<h1>Marvel Fan-Art Asks: What If Captain America</h1>

	<p>Tony Stark was the one to sacrifice his life and save half of the universe in Avengers: Endgame. However, would things have been different had Steve Rogers taken on the Infinity Gauntlet challenge instead of Stark? Some new fan artwork features Rogers with his broken shield as he prepares to snap his fingers with the homemade Gauntlet that Stark put together. While the snap was too much for Stark to handle, Captain America's Super Soldier Serum may have been able to save the day and his life, or he may have ended up worse than Stark.
</p>

	The artwork was done by Ellejart and it is really well done and detailed. The image of Steve Rogers preparing to snap his fingers prompted a big reaction from Marvel Studios fans. There are many people in the comments section hoping Rogers is getting ready to snap Spider-Man back into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Sadly, this is some fan-art from the fictional Endgame movie, so it's not going to get Peter Parker back under the Marvel Studios banner, though those fans can continue to think those positive thoughts.
